A gfortran fork
========
Homebrew is doing a terible job of supporting 32 bit systems.  It's its importaint to stay in Vogue when you run a mac I guess.

This was how I was able to build Gfortran on my 32 bit MBP using Xcode 4.2, the last version of xcode ever released for my laptop.


I'll eventially update this when I need to update gfortran on my laptop.

This is a total hack as I dont know ruby.
